# AltaBaixa_ODC
This is a Master's group project developed in 2021.

Alta & Baixa is a magazine of typographic culture that aims to reflect on all aspects of typography, including its history, and whose contents are deliberately eclectic. It aims to publish historical and contemporary material from academic and journalistic sources. The magazine intends to publish its first issue in print and on the web, conveying the conviction that design should be in harmony with content.

The aim of the project was to create the web version of the magazine, in landing page format.
